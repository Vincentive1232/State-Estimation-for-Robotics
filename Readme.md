# State-Estimation-for-Robotics
In this project we tried several different pipelines including Linear Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter and Point-Cloud Alignment(Batch Gauss-Newton Estimator) to tackle different state estimation problems.

The problem descriptions are listed in 4 seperated pdfs.
