# State-Estimation-for-Robotics
In this project we tried several different pipelines including Linear Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter and Point-Cloud Alignment(Batch Gauss-Newton Estimator) to tackle different state estimation problems.

The tasks are allocated as:
1. [Proves](https://github.com/Vincentive1232/State-Estimation-for-Robotics/tree/master/SER_A1_Final)
1. [Batch Linear-Gaussian Estimator](https://github.com/Vincentive1232/State-Estimation-for-Robotics/tree/master/SER_A2_Final)
1. [Iterative Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/Vincentive1232/State-Estimation-for-Robotics/tree/master/SER_A3_Final)
1. [Batch Gauss-Newton Estimator](https://github.com/Vincentive1232/State-Estimation-for-Robotics/tree/master/SER_A4_Final)
